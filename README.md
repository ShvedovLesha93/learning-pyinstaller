# Learning PyInstaller

A sample `PySide6` application demonstrating how to build cross-platform desktop applications with internationalization (i18n) support using a lightweight `uv`-based bootstrap launcher.

## How it works

Instead of bundling all libraries into a large exe, `PyInstaller` only packages a small launcher. On first run, the launcher uses `uv` to download and install all dependencies into a local `.venv` next to the executable. Subsequent launches skip this step entirely. The final installer is built with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

## Features

- ✨ Simple `PySide6` GUI with language switching
- 🌍 Internationalization support using `gettext`
- 🔄 Runtime language switching between English and Russian
- 📦 Lightweight launcher — only a small exe is shipped, dependencies are fetched on first run
- 🚀 Fully isolated environment — `uv` manages its own Python, no system Python required

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip

## Installation

### Using UV (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShvedovLesha93/learning-pyinstaller.git
cd learning-pyinstaller

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShvedovLesha93/learning-pyinstaller.git
cd learning-pyinstaller

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install PySide6 pyinstaller
```

## Running in Development

```bash
# Using UV
uv run python main.py

# Using regular Python
python main.py
```

## Building

### 1. Build the launcher and assemble dist
```bash
uv run python build.py
```

The `dist/` folder will be assembled with:
- `MyApp.exe` — the launcher (built by PyInstaller, no dependencies bundled)
- App source files, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock`

### 2. Build the installer

Open `installer.iss` in [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and click Build, or run from the command line:
```bash
iscc installer.iss
```

The final `mysetup.exe` installer will be placed in `release/`.
